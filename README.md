## About Me
My name is **Stephon Treadwell**. I am 30 years old and I am looking to change job careers from being in Law Enforcement to becoming a full time software engineer. I'll be attending Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in April. I'm really excited about this journey that I am taking this year!
<p>I have no experience whatsoever in coding! However, having friends in the industry and talking to them about it encourages me to take on the many challenges that becoming a software engineer comes with. I am really excited about this journey!</p>
